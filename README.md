# osu!request
An osu! beatmapset request client with Twitch integration built on top of the [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework). Communicates with a server which handles all the requests, storing of data, and anything else that may be added in the future.

Currently there are no releases as the app doesn't have all the features planned. However, it is in a working state, and the guide on how to get started is below

## Getting Started
Get the latest release from the releases tab on the right, then run the executable. You will be automatically sent to the settings where you will enter your twitch channel name (this is case sensitive) and your code. The code can be generated by clicking the "Login with Twitch" button. If your code ever expires, you will be notified and will be asked to login with Twitch again. Then, click the "Save and Connect" button and osu!request will handle everything else. Requests can be taken from chat by having users type "!rq [beatmapsetId]".

This guide is subject to change as the application evolves... Please check back with every release in case anything major changes
